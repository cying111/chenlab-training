# Bambu 

There are quite a few tools for performing transcript discovery and quantification using long read transcriptomics RNA sequencing. Here we used ***Bambu*** , it allows for multi-sample transcript discovery and quantification, while being relatively efficient compared to other methods. 

For more details on installation and potential downstream analysis, you can refer [the github page](https://github.com/GoekeLab/bambu) or [the bioconductor site](http://bioconductor.org/packages/bambu/).
