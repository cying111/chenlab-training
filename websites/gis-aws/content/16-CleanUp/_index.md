In this final segment of the workshop, you will learn how to clean up after yourself. In AWS, it's easy to spin up instances, make storage volumes, and security groups. The only problem? They can drain your budget if you forget to delete the resources you don't use. In this section, we will:

-   Terminate EC2 instances
-	Delete S3 buckets
-	Make room in the budget for pizza
