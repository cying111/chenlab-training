In this final segment of the workshop, you will learn how to clean up after yourself. It's easy to spin up instances, make storage volumes, and save snapshots and AMIs. The only problem? They can drain your budget if you forget to delete the resources you don't use. In this section, we will:

- Terminate EC2 instances
- Delete S3 buckets
- Delete EBS Volumes
- Remove all generated AMIs and Snapshots
- Make room in the budget for pizza
