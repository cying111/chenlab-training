Costs are an imporant consideration while running workloads on the cloud. Being cognizant about how services incur costs would help in large savings as well as help you realize adopting policies and more sophisticated services that are better tailored for the specific workload being run. It is a good practice to understand how the usage of specific features and services can lead to saving costs.

In this section of the workshop we will provide a a brief introduction to costs associated with services on AWS as well as demonstrate how costs could be saved for specific services taking services like EC2 and EBS that we have just as examples:


In this section you will :

- Explore Instance States and associated costs.

- Saving a snaphot of the EBS Volume

- Terminate EC2 instance and delete EBS volumes.
