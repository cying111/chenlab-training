Costs are an imporant consideration while running workloads on the cloud. Being cognizant about how services incur costs helps in savings, adoption of efficient workflows, and use of sophisticated services that are better tailored for your current workload. It is a good practice to understand how the usage of specific features and services can lead to saving costs.

In this section of the workshop we will provide a brief introduction to costs associated with services on AWS as well as demonstrate how costs could be saved for specific services taking services like EC2 and EBS.


In this section you will :

- Explore Instance States and associated costs.

- Save a snaphot of the EBS Volume.

- Terminate EC2 instance and delete EBS Volumes.
