You will now learn to share an S3 Bucket with your collaborator i.e.  
1.	Transferring data to your private bucket, but giving a collaborator access to one file in that bucket.  
2.	Giving a collaborator access to a public bucket with their files (and only them)  
	& Transferring a file securely to your collaboratorâ€™s bucket.
