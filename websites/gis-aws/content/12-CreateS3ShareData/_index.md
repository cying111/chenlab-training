We will now create an S3 bucket, upload our results and related data files to this S3 bucket, and share a folder in the S3 bucket with another user for them to access and download the data.

In this section of the workshop you will:

1.	Create an AWS S3 bucket.

2.	Upload and transfer files to S3.

3.	Make S3 objects public.

4.	**22-23 June 2022 onwards** 
	Perform a large-scale long read data analyses by accessing data via [AWS Open Data Program](https://aws.amazon.com/opendata)
