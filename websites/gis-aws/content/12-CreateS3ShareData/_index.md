We will now create an S3 bucket, upload our results and related data files to this S3 bucket, and share a folder in the S3 bucket with another user for them to access and download the data.

In this section of the workshop you will:

1.	Create an S3 bucket.

2.	Transfer files to the bucket.

3.	Share data by providing access to a folder in the bucket.
