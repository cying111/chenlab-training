2.	AWS CLI  

### **Using AWS Console (via GUI)**

1.      In the AWS Management Console search bar, type **S3**.

2.      Click on **S3** to open the **Amazon S3** Console.

3.      Scroll through the list of buckets and click on your new bucket. **NOTE**: make sure you click on the bucket name link, and not just select the bucket using the checkbox.

5.      Either drag and drop files or click  **Add Files** to browse and select the files to be uploaded. For the sake of this workshop, add a small text file or any other dummy file / image that does **NOT** contain sensitive information.

## **Using AWS CLI (from the EC2 instance)** 
>_**IMPORTANT**: Make sure you have configured the AWS CLI credentials (Refer to section V.a for AWS CLI configure commands)._

1.      Run the AWS CLI command to list all the S3 buckets associated with the account in the region configured with **aws configure**.

```bash
aws s3 ls
```

Output will be a list of buckets including the new bucket which was created above.

2.      Run AWS CLI commands.

**List the contents of the bucket**

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://{Bucket Name}
```

Verify that the output includes your uploaded files.


**Download files from the S3 bucket**

To download files we will use the AWS CLI **s3 cp** command.

```bash
aws s3 cp s3://{Bucket Name}/{object name} ./
```

Verify the download by listing the directory and confirm the object is present.

For more detailed steps on AWS CLI for S3 refer to Section VI (**Download data shared using Amazon S3**) of the workshop.


**Upload files to the S3 bucket**

 To upload files we will use the AWS CLI **s3 cp** command.

```bash
aws s3 cp ./{your-file} s3://{Bucket Name}/
```

3.      Verify the contents of the S3 bucket after the copy is completed via command line (below) or by using the AWS Console.

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://{Bucket Name}
```
