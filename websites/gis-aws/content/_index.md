# Welcome to the online Cloud Genomics Workshop
**<font size="30">Genome Institute of Singapore and Amazon Web Services</font>**

The Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS) is the national flagship program for the genomic sciences in Singapore, started in 2000 by the Agency for Science, Research and Technology (A*STAR). Our vision is to use the genomic sciences to achieve extraordinary improvements in human health and public prosperity. We read, reveal, and write DNA for a better Singapore and world!

Amazon Web Services provides the most elastic and scalable cloud infrastructure to run your [HPC applications](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/). With virtually unlimited capacity, engineers, researchers, and HPC system owners can innovate beyond the limitations of on-premises HPC infrastructure.

AWS delivers an integrated suite of services that provides everything you need to quickly and easily build and manage HPC clusters in the cloud to run the most compute intensive workloads across various industry verticals.

These workloads span the traditional HPC applications, like genomics, computational chemistry, financial risk modeling, computer aided engineering, weather prediction, and seismic imaging, as well as emerging applications, like machine learning, deep learning, and autonomous driving.

HPC on AWS removes the long wait times and lost productivity often associated with on-premises HPC clusters. Flexible configuration and virtually unlimited scalability allow you to grow and shrink your infrastructure as your workloads dictate, not the other way around. Additionally, with access to a broad portfolio of cloud-based services like Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML), you can redefine traditional HPC workflows to innovate faster.

Today, more cloud-based HPC applications run on AWS than on any other cloud.
