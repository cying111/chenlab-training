In many cases it is more convenient to provide not just the data files but also the whole environment to process or reproduce results. In addition to this, it is also important to support collaborators to run their own analyses but not have to go through re-builing the setup.

In such cases we could share the AMI as well as the snapshot of the EBS volume with a specific account.

In this section of the workshop you will:

1.	Share the AMI with a specific AWS account.

2.	Share an EBS volume with a specific AWS account.
