In many cases it is more convenient to provide not just the data files but also the whole environment to process or reproduce results. This will enable collaborators to run their own analyses without re-building your setup or environment.

In such cases we could share the AMI as well as the snapshot of the EBS volume with a specific account.

In this section of the workshop you will:

1.	Share the AMI with a specific AWS account.

2.	Share an EBS snapshot with a specific AWS account.
