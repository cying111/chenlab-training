We will now create a new volume from the snapshot of the volume we had created  and used earlier.

In this section of the workshop you will:

1.	Create a new volume from the snapshot created earlier.

2.	Attach the new volume to an EC2 instance.

3.	Mount the volume and verify earlier copied data exists.
