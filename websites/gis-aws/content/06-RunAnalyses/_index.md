In this section we will run bioinformatic analyses on the EC2 instance. Here you will:

**a.	[Run bacterial genome analyses i.e map FASTQ reads to a reference sequence, call SNPs and assemble a genome.](http://slchen-lab-training.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/06-runanalyses/02-bacanalyses.html)**  
**b.	**From 22-23 June 2022** [Run transcript discovery and quantification with long-read RNA-Seq analysis using R.](http://slchen-lab-training.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/06-runanalyses/03-bambuday1.html)**
