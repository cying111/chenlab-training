Costs are an important consideration while running workloads on the cloud. Being cognizant about how services incur costs would help in large savings as well as help you adopt policies and more sophisticated services that are better tailored for your specific workload. It is a good practice to understand how the usage of specific features of a service can help save costs.

Here we will provide an introduction to the costs on AWS as well as demonstrate how costs could be saved for specific services like EC2 and EBS. 

This section will present:

- A brief introduction to Billing.
