Projecting costs before utilizing resources is not only required for budgeting but to also look at possiblities to optimize current costs. There are several resources available to look at projecting costs. Here is a quick glance on how to view pricing for specific AWS services. 

**Exploring the specific AWS Service page**
Every AWS service has its own web page with a **pricing** section to provide more information on costs associated with the service. Here are the pricing web page links for EC2, S3 and EBS.


- [EC2 Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/) 

- [EBS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/pricing/)
