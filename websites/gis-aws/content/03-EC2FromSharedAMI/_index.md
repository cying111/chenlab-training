This workshop section walks you through setting up your own EC2 Linux instance from a premade AMI, which you will use to run analyses in later sections of the workshop.

Specifically, you learn how to:

- Sign in to the AWS Management Console and explore it.
- Create an Amazon EC2 instance from an AMI. 
- SSH into an EC2 instance and run Linux commands.

<!-- Total cost to run this lab is expected to be less than **two dollars should you run it on your own or company account** if the guide is followed as discussed, in one sitting, and including the deletion of all resources outlined through the guide. -->
