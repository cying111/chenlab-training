This workshop section walks you through setting up your own EC2 Linux instance from a premade AMI, which you will use to run analyses in later sections of the workshop.

Specifically, you learn how to:

- [Sign in to the AWS Management Console and explore it.](http://slchen-lab-training.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/03-ec2fromsharedami/04-aws-ec2-dashboard.html)
- [Create an Amazon EC2 instance from an AMI.](http://slchen-lab-training.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/03-ec2fromsharedami/06-launchec2instance.html) 
- [SSH into an EC2 instance and run Linux commands.](http://slchen-lab-training.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/03-ec2fromsharedami/07-sshec2instance.html)

<!-- Total cost to run this lab is expected to be less than **two dollars should you run it on your own or company account** if the guide is followed as discussed, in one sitting, and including the deletion of all resources outlined through the guide. -->
