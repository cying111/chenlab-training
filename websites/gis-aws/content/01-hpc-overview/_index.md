<!-- Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides the most elastic and scalable cloud infrastructure to run your [High Performance Computing (HPC) applications](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/). With virtually unlimited capacity, engineers, researchers, and HPC system owners can innovate beyond the limitations of on-premises HPC infrastructure.

AWS delivers an integrated suite of services that provides everything you need to quickly and easily build and manage HPC clusters in the cloud to run the most compute intensive workloads across various industry verticals.

These workloads span the traditional HPC applications, like genomics, computational chemistry, financial risk modeling, computer aided engineering, weather prediction, and seismic imaging, as well as emerging applications, like machine learning, deep learning, and autonomous driving.

HPC on AWS removes the long wait times and lost productivity often associated with on-premises HPC clusters. Flexible configuration and virtually unlimited scalability allow you to grow and shrink your infrastructure as your workloads dictate, not the other way around. Additionally, with access to a broad portfolio of cloud-based services like data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML), you can redefine traditional HPC workflows to innovate faster.

Today, more cloud-based HPC applications run on AWS than on any other cloud. -->

Welcome to the AWS-GIS training on cloud computing for genomics researchers.


This series of workshops is designed to get you familiar with the concepts and best practices to understand AWS components that help to build setup a compute server on the cloud and run a genomics workload.

**Target audience and requirements**:

- Genomics researchers who have some experience of Linux commands
- Participants have an IAM account created for them (either by PI's lab or free credits by AWS) and they have their credentials available.
- Little to no exposure to cloud computing. We will cover fundamental AWS concepts and not advanced topics such as AWS Batch.
- No bioinformatics training will be provided in this course.

**Background**: Your team has been asked to align raw reads from bacterial genome sequences. We are going to do this on AWS. You will be uploading data onto AWS storage services and subsequently run the Analyses tools on the AWS compute services.
