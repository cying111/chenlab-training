Depending on your workshop, you may access the AWS Management Console through Event Engine or through a traditional sign-in. This page will guide you through signing in via the Event Engine.  
  
Your instructor will provide you with a special team hash login, and an AWS Account ID. 
Click the team hash login link. An email address will be requested for an OTP. This will help you access your temporary AWS account. When your sign in is successful, you will be taken to the **Team Dashboard**.

Next, click on the **AWS Console** button.  

This page is quite important.  
  
First, note the region that is specified in red. This will be the location of all your resources, and is the default region for this exercise.  
  
Next, note the credentials seen in the box titled **Credentials / CLI Snippets**. This will be important later when configuring your machine. Depending on your OS, click the correct tab and note the contents.
