2.	Choose **EC2** to open the **EC2 Dashboard**. 

Instances may be launched via a graphical user interface (the console) or with command line scripts. We'll start with the graphical console interface first, known as the **EC2 Dashbord**.

Spend a few minutes familiarizing yourself with the layout of the dashboard:

- **Left Navigation pane**: Tools and features, such as the saved Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), storage volumes, and ssh keys.
- **Center**: Resource listings and the ability to launch an instance. 
- **Right pane**: General information, such as documentation and pricing.
