# Bioinformatics software
Bioinformatics is moving very fast. It's hard to keep up with version changes, and because of some details of academic funding and training, there is a lot of variation in organization and design.

I've split this section into two parts - software that can be installed a relatively "standard" unix-like manner, and those that require some custom updates or custom configuration.
* [Software that follows a standard installation](#standard-installs)
* [Software requiring some customization](#customized-installs)
